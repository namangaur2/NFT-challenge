## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

* I learned how to implement the CSS properties, especially the Flexbox.
* I also learned about hover effect i.e. 

```css
heading h4 a:hover{

    cursor: pointer;
    color: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.685);
    
    transition: 0.2s;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to further practice positioning and transitioning the elements, using flexbox and using gridbox.


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - This helped me in using pseudo-classes and in CSS.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This resource helped me a lot in using flexbox and CSS.
